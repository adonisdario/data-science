# Who is the best goalkeeper of the 2023/24 season from the top 5 leagues?

Following the Yashin trophy nominees for the best goalkeeper of the season, in this project, I will determine the top goalkeepers of the 2023/24 season from the top 5 football leagues, through data scrapped from the fbref.com . Using python and It's libraries available, let's explore the data and create a chart to show the goalkeepers that stoodout, for good and for bad.

#### Note

This study will include only the top 5 european leagues, England, Spain, Italy, Germany and France. Meaning that other leagues, national cups, continental tournaments, and international friendlies and tournaments will not be accounted. 

## Introduction

Using the links below, I was able to retrieve all the information I needed to create this notebook.

1st link: https://fbref.com/en/comps/Big5/2023-2024/keepers/players/2023-2024-Big-5-European-Leagues-Stats

2nd link: https://fbref.com/en/comps/Big5/2023-2024/keepersadv/players/2023-2024-Big-5-European-Leagues-Stats

The fbref.com site is free and has a good amount of data that can be used to create the analysis.
The first link will lead to standard goalkeeper stats, and the second link has advanced stats like PSxG and other data that I will not use.
Initially, I will restructure the tables, rename columns, delete columns, clean registers with NaN and merge the two tables.

## Standards

For a goalkeeper to be considered top, it has to fulfill the following criteria: 

- Played at least 42% of the league season games;
> *16 games for the Premier League, La Liga or Serie A which have 20 teams for a total of 38 rounds or 14 games at Bundesliga or Ligue 1 which have 18 teams for a total of 34 rounds.*

- Have high % of saves;
> *The Save % is the number of balls saved devided by total of Shots On Target Against. Higher Save % means that the goalkeeper is saving a lot of the shots he is facing.*

- Have a high PSxG +/- for every 100 xG;

> *PSxG is a metric that tells the chance of the goal to be scored after the shot was taken, considering the position of the ball, the position of the defenders and the position of the goalkeeper, including penalties kicks.*

> *PSxG +/- is the difference between the sum of the PSxG from all the shots faced and the total goals allowed (GA, not including Own Goals). Positive PSxG +/- means that the goalkeeper avoided a lot of high chance goals. Negative means that the goalkeeper is conceding more low chance goals.*

> Finally, for this metric, we want to determine how many goals can a goalkeeper avoid when facing 100 expected goals.

- Consider the quantity of SoTA/90 and Saves/90;

> *This metrics are going to show the weakness of the defensive linemen. High number of Shots on Target Against /90 and a high number of Saves /90 means that the defence is weak and the goalkeeper is outstanding. The contrary means that the defence is good but the goalkeeper is failing.*

### Rejected metrics

Goals conceded and Clean sheets were discarded because these metrics are for the entire defensive system, not only for the goalkeeper. Other metrics that shows the ability of a goalkeeper to build play, sweepes, passes and crossing are discarted as well. This study will turn into acount only the ball stopping ability of the goalkeeper.

## Chart

The scatterplot is built by the Save% v PSxG +/- for 100xG. The size of the points means the Save/90. The 'hotter' the collor means more 90s the keepers have played. If a goalkeeper is at the top right of the chart, they are the best, and if it's at the bottom left of the chart, they are the worst.
The Save% mean is 70.8%, and the PSxG +/- for 100xG mean is -1.69. The red line is the trendline of the chart.

### Worst Goalkeeper Analysis

- **S. Johnstone** (C. Palace): Great defense, Awful goalkeeping, Injured in 47% of the games.
  -   GK: 95th in Save% (62.7%) | 100th in Goals Avoided (-30.0) | 98th in Saves/90 (2.1) | 53% of 90s played

    > *His team conceded a regular amount of Shots on target with an average of regular value chances. Having a regular defence, Consigli underperformed his defence by far, playing almost all games available and earning his place at the Worst goalkeepers list*

### Matz Sels

This goalkeeper is on the list of the worst of the Season, but he has a peculiarity. He is the only player that played for two different clubs. And he was bad at **both**.

![alt text](https://github.com/adonisdario/data-science/blob/main/best-gk-2023-24/images/5.png?raw=true)

- **Matz Sels (Strasbourg and N. Forest combined):** Great defences, Awful goalkeeping.
  -   GK: 98th in Save% (60.2%) | 99th in Goals Avoided (-27.7) | 95th in Saves/90 (2.2) | 98% of 90s played
  - Team: 14th in SoTA/90 (3.5) | 21st in PSxG/90 (1.1)
    > *His teams conceded **very few** Shots on target with low value chances in average. Still, his performances were terrible, being in the bottom 5 of Save%, Goals Avoided and Saves/90.*

Now, let's analyse his performance for each team.

- **Matz Sels (Strasbourg x Nottinham Forest):**
  
  GK:
    -  Save%:         94th  (62.9%) | **101st (57.4%)**
    -  Goals Avoided: 77th  (-10.0) | **101st (-45.4)**
    -  Saves/90:      **97th  (2.1)**   | 93rd  (2.3)
    -  90s played:    56%           | 42%
      
  Team:
    - SoTA/90:        9th   (3.3)    | **24th (3.8)**
    - PSxG/90:        20th  (1.05)   | **24th (1.08)**

Strasbourg:
  > *Strasbourg had a very good defense, conceding very few Shots on Target with very low value chances, and still was struggling because of M. Sels being at the bottom 10 of Save%, Saves/90 and having bad number Goals Avoided;*

  > *After M. Sels departure, Alaa Bellaarouch took his place. His performances were slightly better than Sels', still it was very bad. However, the defensive linemen got worse and Strasbourg struggled to secure a place in the Ligue 1.*
 
Nottingham Forest:
  > *Before M. Sels arrival at N. Forest, the team was 64th in SoTA/90 (4.6) and 62nd in PSxG/90 (1.4). As for the goalkeepers, they were 100th in Save% (58.8%), 101st in Goals Avoided (-39.3) and 82nd in Saves/90 (2.5);*

  > *After M. Sels arrival, the defensive linemen improved from regular to good, but not because of Sels' performances. In fact, he was slightly worse than the previous goalkeepers, becoming the worst goalkeeper in Save%, Goals Avoided and bottom 10 in Saves/90.*

### Worst Goalie Conclusion

**M. Sels** stood out as the worst goalkeeper from the top5 leagues. He was in 2 different teams, with good defensive linemen and still had the worst numbers. Strasbourg and N. Forest struggled to secure a place in the 1st division of their leagues mostly because of M. Sels' performances.

## Outliers

Looking at the chart of the best goalkeepers there are two that cought my attention: E. Mart√≠nez and M. Maignan. They were very good at one metric and very bad at the other.

![alt text](https://github.com/adonisdario/data-science/blob/main/best-gk-2023-24/images/4.png?raw=true)

### Outliers Analysis

- **E. Mart√≠nez** (Aston Villa): Low Save% but a lot of Goals Avoided.
  -   GK: 81st in Save% (66.2%) | 11th in Goals Avoided (+13.4) | 61st in Saves/90 (2.8) | 88% of 90s played
  - Team: 41st in SoTA/90 (4.2) | 73rd in PSxG/90 (1.5)
    > *His team conceded a regular amount of Shots on target with an average of **high** value chances. E. Mart√≠nez didn't make a lot of saves, but the saves that he made were fantastic.*
    
- **M. Maignan** (Milan): Very High Save% but very low Goals Avoided.
  -   GK:  7th in Save% (77.5%) | 87th in Goals Avoided (-14.1) | 52nd in Saves/90 (3.0) | 76% of 90s played
  - Team: 40th in SoTA/90 (4.1) | 16th in PSxG/90 (1.0)
    > *His team conceded a regular amount of Shots on target with an average of **very low** value chances. M. Maignan had a solid defence that forced the opposition to have low value chances. Sometimes when things got tricky for the defensive linemen, Maignan did'nt excelled.*

### Outliers Conclusion

E. Mart√≠nez was the goalkeeper that is there when you need him the most. His team was agressive and he made important saves when his defence got past by. He was the star of the defense. M. Maignan on the other hand could've made his team one of the top defenses of the world, if he had made the hardest saves.
